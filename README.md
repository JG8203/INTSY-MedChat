## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** CSINTSY Gamebot 1
- **Release Date:** 5 September 2023
- **MCO2 (Chatbot) Project Specifications Due Date:** 19 November 2023

## Learning Outcomes

This project aims to fulfill the following learning outcomes:
- [ ] LO1: Design and evaluate informed search algorithms and knowledge representations for problem solving.
- [ ] LO2: Collaboratively build and evaluate an expert system prototype for a specific user group.
- [ ] LO5: Present results and articulate ideas in correct technical written and oral English.

## Project Description

### Medical Diagnostic Chatbot
- [ ] Develop a chatbot expert in diagnosing at least 15 diseases prevalent in poor or rural communities in the Philippines.
- [ ] Utilize a question-and-answer interface with a backward-chaining expert system.
- [ ] May replace the domain with one of similar relevance and complexity if needed.

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Group Formation
- [x] Form a group of a maximum of 4 members.

### Task 2: Setup
- [x] Download Prolog from https://www.swi-prolog.org/

### Task 3: Disease Selection
- [x] Select 15 diseases for the chatbot to diagnose.

### Task 4: Build Knowledge Base
- [x] Option 1: Interview an expert in the field with at least 5 years of experience.
- [ ] Option 2: Review at least 10 related papers or credible websites for disease information.
- [ ] Avoid using expensive laboratory tests in the diagnosis process.
- [ ] Focus on basic patient information and simple diagnostic methods.
- [ ] Assume diagnosis takes place in a resource-limited setting.
- [ ] Include visual diagnosis with a glossary of pictures.
- [ ] Use a stethoscope for diagnosis in certain cases.
- [ ] Determine a diagnosis with a certainty factor in emergency situations.
- [ ] Refer to a larger medical facility if necessary.

### Task 5: Development
- [ ] Develop the chatbot using Prolog.

### Task 6: Report Writing
- [ ] Write a report documenting the development process and chatbot evaluation.
